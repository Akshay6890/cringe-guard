# cringe-guard

A prototype chrome extension that filters out cringe content on my LinkedIn feed.

## TODO 
- make a new logo which indicates it's a cringe guard
- allow people to put their api key via popup.html
- allow people to select their custom types of posts they want to see (and cringe guard posts they don't want to see)
